# File Manager App (Beginner Python Project)

This is a simple file manager program that I made as a beginner while learning Python.  
I wanted to understand how file handling works, so I created this small project.  
It is not advanced, but it helped me learn the basics and practice writing code on my own.

## What I Learned

While making this project, I learned:

- How to create, read, edit, and delete files in Python  
- How to use the `os` module to work with files in a folder  
- How to show a menu and take choices from the user  
- How to handle errors using `try` and `except`  
- How to use functions to keep the code clean  
- How to upload my project to GitHub  

This project really helped me understand how Python interacts with files.

## Why I Made This Project

I made this project because I wanted to practice Python basics in a practical way.  
As a beginner, I wanted to build something small that works and teaches me real programming skills.  
This file manager app was a good first step for me.

## How the App Works

When the program starts, it shows a menu with 6 options:

1. Create a file  
2. View all files  
3. Delete a file  
4. Read a file  
5. Edit a file  
6. Exit  

The user can choose any option by entering a number.  
Then the program performs that action and shows the menu again until the user selects "Exit".

## How to Run the Program

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.  
2. Download or clone this repository.  
3. Open the project folder in your terminal or command prompt.  
4. Run the file using this command:

## Future Improvements (When I Learn More)

There are many things I want to add later as I keep learning, such as:

- Adding colors to the menu so it looks better  
- Adding an option to rename files  
- Creating a small graphical interface  
- Cleaning and organizing the code more properly  
- Adding a search option to find files quickly  
- Adding more error handling  
- Making the menu more user-friendly  

I will try to update this project step by step as I learn more concepts.

## Final Note

I am still learning Python, and this is one of my first real projects.  
I know the project is simple, but I am happy that I was able to build it on my own and make it work.  
This small project gave me confidence to try bigger things, and I will keep improving it as I learn more. 🙂
